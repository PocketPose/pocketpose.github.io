Pruning is a technique for reducing the number of parameters in a neural network by removing the weights of the least important connections. This can be done by setting the weights of these connections to zero, or by removing the connections entirely. Pruning is a form of network compression, and can be used to reduce the size of the model and improve inference speed.
