Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is the task of estimating a person’s pose from an image or video by detecting keypoints—such as joints (elbow, shoulder, hip, knee) or other anatomical landmarks. This problem is commonly formulated as a regression task, where a model predicts the spatial coordinates of these keypoints given an input image.

## Pose Estimation Techniques

Pose estimation approaches can be categorized based on five key dimensions:

This classification is not exhaustive, and many works combine elements from different categories. For example, a model may use RGB-D images for 3D pose estimation, a top-down approach for multi-person detection, and a heatmap-based regression for keypoint prediction.


## Pose Estimation Pipelines

Pose estimation models typically follow a structured pipeline that transforms raw input data into accurate keypoint predictions. This pipeline consists of three key stages:

### 1. Preprocessing
Before feeding an image or video into a pose estimation model, various preprocessing techniques are applied to improve robustness and generalization:

- **Normalization**: Rescales pixel values to a standard range (e.g., $$[0,1]$$ or $$[-1,1]$$) to ensure numerical stability during training.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applies transformations such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and color jittering to enhance model generalization.
- **Cropping & Resizing**: Ensures consistent input dimensions, especially in top-down approaches where bounding boxes are extracted.
- **Keypoint Encoding**: For heatmap-based methods, ground-truth keypoints $$(x_i, y_i)$$ are converted into Gaussian heatmaps:

  $$
  H_i(x, y) = \exp \left(-\frac{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right)
  $$

  where $$\sigma$$ controls the spread of the heatmap.

### 2. Inference
Once preprocessed, the image is passed through a neural network, which predicts keypoint locations using one of the following strategies:

- **Heatmap-based Regression**: The model outputs a probability distribution over possible keypoint locations, where the highest-intensity region corresponds to the estimated keypoint.
- **Direct Coordinate Regression**: The model directly predicts keypoint coordinates $$(x, y)$$ in 2D or $$(x, y, z)$$ in 3D.
- **Transformer-Based Methods**: Recent approaches leverage attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and improve pose estimation accuracy.

### 3. Post-Processing
After obtaining raw predictions from the model, post-processing techniques refine the results:

- **Argmax or Softmax**: For heatmap-based methods, the keypoint position is extracted as:

  $$
  (x_i, y_i) = \arg \max_{(x, y)} H_i(x, y)
  $$

  where $$H_i(x, y)$$ is the heatmap for keypoint $$i$$.
  
- **Pose Refinement**: Techniques such as temporal smoothing (for video), spatial optimization (e.g., Perspective-n-Point (PnP) for 3D), and model-based constraints (e.g., kinematic priors) improve accuracy.
- **Multi-Person Association**: Bottom-up approaches require keypoint grouping to distinguish between individuals.

Each stage plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate and robust human pose estimation, especially when dealing with challenging scenarios such as occlusions, motion blur, or extreme poses.
