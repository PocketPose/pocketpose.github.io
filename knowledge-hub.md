Welcome to the **Human Pose Estimation (HPE) Knowledge Hub**, your go-to resource for learning everything about **2D and 3D pose estimation**—from foundational concepts to state-of-the-art techniques.

This hub is designed to help **students, researchers, and practitioners** gain a deep understanding of HPE through structured tutorials, covering:
- 🏗 **Core principles** behind pose estimation  
- 🔬 **Deep learning models** for 2D and 3D human pose estimation  
- 📈 **Advanced techniques** including multi-person tracking, real-time inference, and motion modeling  
- 🛠 **Implementation guides** for integrating HPE models into real-world applications  

If you're new to the field, start with [**Basic Concepts**](basics) to build a strong foundation in **keypoint-based representations, datasets, and evaluation metrics**.
